## About This Project
### Important to Note
This is an SOA app and needs both this repo (front end) AND [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white) ](https://github.com/In-The-Field/In_The_Field_BE) (back end) in order to be fully functioning.

### Mod 4 Capstone Project
In the Field is a mushroom identification app. Designed for folks looking to explore, learn about, and identify mushrooms. In the Field has the ability for registered users to upload pictures from mushrooms they have found in the wild and get a list of probable matches complete with information about said mushroom. Users also have the ability to create their own field guide of mushrooms they have saved.
